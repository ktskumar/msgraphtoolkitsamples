# msgraphtoolkitsamples
This repository contains samples that demonstrate different usages patterns for the Microsoft Graph Toolkit web components

There are different files under examples/js-apps/views folder  contains the example of each component. The below is the list,
allcomponents.html
getallusers.html
groupandmembers.html
heirarchyview.html
plannertasks-timeline.html
recentitems.html
roleandmembers.html

Each file is independent, so we have to add the Client ID to each file, and also we have to add the each file url as redirect URL in App Registrtation portal.

## STEPS
* Under Views folder, open any html
* Search for [[CLIENT-ID], available im mgt-msal-provider element, replace this with the your Client ID from your registration app. How to - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgZJEEoRk4w&t=14s
* Save the file

* Navigate to App Registration Portal and select your App.
* Then add the localhost html location in Redirect URL in your registered app

* Everything is ready run `npm install`
* Then run `npm start`
